# TSwift Tunes: Exploring, Recommending & Searching Through Taylor Swift's Music

Welcome to the **TSwift Tunes** project! This project, completed as part of the DSC 10 course at UC San Diego, explores Taylor Swift‚Äôs music through data analysis and machine learning. It includes visualizations, a song recommender system, and a lyrics searcher, all powered by the `tswift` dataset. The project answers key questions about her songs and albums, analyzes audio features, and provides interactive tools for song recommendations and lyric searching.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the following components:

- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: We use the `tswift` DataFrame to explore Taylor Swift's music and answer key questions.
- **Song Recommendation System**: We built a recommender that suggests similar songs based on audio features and user preferences.
- **Lyrics Searcher**: A tool that allows you to search for specific lyrics in Taylor Swift's songs using TF-IDF.
- **Keyword Extraction**: We identify key terms that best summarize each song from Taylor Swift's album *Lover*.

## Data Exploration and Visualization üëÄ

In this section, we explore Taylor Swift's music through various visualizations, helping us answer the following key questions:

- **How many songs did Taylor Swift release each year?**  
  We analyze Taylor Swift's discography over time and track her song releases year by year.

- **How do different audio features like 'Loudness' and 'Energy' relate to one another?**  
  We create visualizations to explore the correlation between features such as loudness and energy across her songs.

- **Are Taylor Swift's songs generally more positive or more negative?**  
  We perform sentiment analysis to assess whether her songs lean towards a positive or negative emotional tone.

- **Which Taylor Swift album has the most songs in a minor key?**  
  We analyze the keys of her songs to identify which album has the highest number of songs in a minor key.

- **Collaborative vs. Solo Songs**:  
  Taylor Swift has collaborated with artists on songs like *"Snow On The Beach (Ft. Lana Del Rey)"* and *"Fortnight (Ft. Post Malone)"*. This visualization compares the average values of **Explicit**, **Danceability**, and **Acousticness** for collaborative versus solo songs using an overlaid vertical bar chart, highlighting the differences in these key features.

These visualizations provide insights into Taylor Swift's musical style, emotional tone, and the evolution of her discography.

## Keyword Extraction üîë

In this component, we perform keyword extraction for each song in Taylor Swift's *Lover* album. We use the **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method to identify the most significant words in the lyrics of each song.

### How it Works:
- **TF-IDF Calculation**: For each song's lyrics, we calculate the frequency of each word (Term Frequency) and how unique the word is across all songs (Inverse Document Frequency).
- **Word Cloud Generation**: After calculating the TF-IDF scores, we visualize the most important words for each song using a word cloud.

### How to Use
- **Select an Album**: Select a song from the dropdown list.
- **Extract Keywords**: The system will calculate the TF-IDF scores for all songs in the album and accordingly extract the top keywords for each song.
- **View Word Clouds**: A word cloud will be generated for each song, displaying the most relevant keywords based on the lyrics.
